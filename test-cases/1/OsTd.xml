 	  The OS shall implement functionality to encrypt sensitive data AND really funny memes
	  stored in non-volatile storage and provide interfaces to applications to invoke this functionality.
        </title>
	<note role="application">Sensitive data shall be identified in the TSS by the ST 
	author, and minimally includes credentials and keys.  The interface for invoking the
	functionality could take a variety of forms: it could consist of an API, 
	or simply well-documented conventions for accessing credentials stored as files.

	  <h:p>
	    The evaluator will check the TSS to ensure that it lists all persistent
            sensitive data for which the OS provides a storage capability.  For each of these
            items, the evaluator will confirm that the TSS lists for what purpose it can be used,
            and how it is stored.  
	    The evaluator will confirm that cryptographic operations used to protect the data occur as specified in <linkref linkend="fcs_cop.1(1)"/>.
	    </h:p><h:p>
	    The evaluator will also consult the developer documentation to verify that an interface
	    exists for applications to securely store credentials.
